  "summary": "MemoryGallerySection.tsx was updated to render a 4-item responsive grid using the four specified image filenames and to open each image in a Dialog modal showing the same photo at larger size. One potential gap is that the diff does not show an explicit, visible close control inside the modal (it may rely on default overlay/ESC behavior from the Dialog component, but that is not evidenced here).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "The expanded view provides a clear close interaction and returns to the same scroll position in the gallery.",
      "reason": "The diff shows DialogTrigger/DialogContent usage but does not show any explicit close UI (e.g., a close button) or any scroll-position preservation logic; it may rely on Dialog defaults, but that is not verifiable from the provided diff summary.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced selectedMemory state and onClick handler to set it, but the state is never used to drive the modal content (each dialog uses the local `memory` mapping instead).",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-16/17/18 and not necessary for the described behavior; also appears unused in the shown code.",
